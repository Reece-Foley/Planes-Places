This map shows the 11 airports I have flown to in a small airplane. 

I have been in multiple Cessnas, a Beach Craft Muskeeter, A Diamond, and an RV-7A.

The airports I have been to the most are Middlesboro, Tazwell, Lexington, and Georgtown.

I have only been the Danville, Pigeon Forge, Myrtle Beach International, and Bowling Green once.

I have soloed at both Georgetown and London.
